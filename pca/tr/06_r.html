                    <p>
                        R has “become the de-facto standard for writing statistical software among statisticians. 
                        This Training on Statistical Data Analysis using R will give you a solid foundation 
                        in creating statistical analysis solutions using the R language, and how to carry out 
                        a range of commonly used analytical processes. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall courses provide the participants with a practical application of the 
                        statistical component of RStudio Statistics. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants will review several statistical techniques, gain an understanding of when and why to 
                        use these various techniques as well as how to apply them with confidence, interpret their output, 
                        and graphically display the results.

                                    of fun but have grown into big business. Statistical analysis also has a key role in medicine, not least

                                    In this specialisation, you’ll take a peek at what medical research is and how – and indeed why – you 
                                    turn a vague notion into a scientifically testable hypothesis. You’ll learn about key statistical 
                                    concepts like sampling, uncertainty, variation, missing values and distributions. 
                                    Then you’ll get your hands dirty with analysing data sets covering some big public 
                                    health challenges – fruit and vegetable consumption and cancer, risk factors for diabetes, 
                                    and predictors of death following heart failure hospitalisation – using R, one of the most
